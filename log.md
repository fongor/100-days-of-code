**Today's Progress:** Back to code

**Thoughts:** I hope I figured out how this github repo log thing works and in a minute I will go back to Free Code Camp

**Today's Progress:** My local weather shower machine was not working anymore, I couldn't understand why, received some help from free code camp's gitter about using ip-api.com instead of navigator, and it worked again. Now I'd like to restyle it a bit.

**Thoughts:** Hum, few months without actual coding, I need to get my hands dirty again quickly.
