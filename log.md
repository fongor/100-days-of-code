**Today's Progress:** Back to code

**Thoughts:** I hope I figured out how this github repo log thing works and in a minute I will go back to Free Code Camp

**Today's Progress:** My local weather viewer was not working anymore, I couldn't understand why, received some help from free code camp's gitter about using ip-api.com instead of navigator, and it worked again. Now I'd like to restyle it a bit.

**Thoughts:** Hum, few months without actual coding, I need to get my hands dirty again quickly.

### Day 2: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Been working on my local weather machine, looks now good on computer, but need to find out how to make it look good on phone as well.

**Thoughts:** I need to really master CSS properties (at least the most important ones) if I don't want to waste time everytime I want to change or adapt something.

### Day 3: January 9th, 2017
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress:** Been playing around with CSS positions and dimensions of boxes inside boxes inside boxes, which allowed me to fix my local weather viewer, which now looks fine both on computer and smartphone

**Thoughts:** CSS is cool. It's tricky, but it's cool.
